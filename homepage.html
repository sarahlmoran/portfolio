            <h3>Hiya! I'm Sarah</h3>
            <p>I am currently a HR Project Manager in the NHS looking to transition into a tech career! <br />I have been in the NHS for six years and feel ready for a new challenge in a different industry!</p>
            <p> I am a bootcamp student on the October 2022 cohort at Manchester and loving it so far. <br /> 
                I found Manchester Codes through a recommendation from a prospective student, <br />
                 coding wasn't something that I had really considered until they suggested it! <br /> 
                I started to research more and completed a few beginner courses to see if coding was for me. <br />
            I quickly realised it was so I dived in and joined a bootcamp! </p>
